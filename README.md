# kbtrain
### A basic, minimalistic terminal-based keyboard practice tool.
## How to build
You need `gcc` installed and a terminal compatible with [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). Both usually come with most GNU/Linux distributions.

In the cloned repository's root run `gcc main.c -o kbtrain` and you'll have kbtrain ready to use. You can run it with `./kbtrain` or "install" it by moving it to the `/bin` folder with `sudo cp kbtrain /bin/` so you can run it anywhere.
## How to use
Run it and start typing.

To quit, press 0.
