# kbtrain
### A basic, minimalistic terminal-based keyboard practice tool.
## How to run
You need python and ncurses installed on your system.

To run it you can go into the repository's folder and run `./kbtrain`

To install it you can run `sudo mv kbtrain /bin/kbtrain` so you can use it anywhere on your system

If you want kbtrain to accept a language besides English or any custom words, take a look at the example file in the repo. English words in the program and Portuguese words in the example file were taken from [Monkeytype](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/tree/master/frontend/static/languages)

## How to use
Run it and start typing! To advance to the next word press any key.
